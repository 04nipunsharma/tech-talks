I usually make several batches and keep some in the freezer so they are handy if I need them.  My family loves them for breakfast or a quick snack.  Some of the variations have been lemon (omit cinnamon and use lemon pudding), peanut butter (add 1 cup of peanut butter cut in the dry ingredients and omit cinnamon),etc.  It also makes a great bundt cake that is like a coffee cake.  It says that you can't put it in the fridge, but I keep bags of the starter in the bottom of my refrigerator so that I can bake when I want - just bring them out for a day ( or at least to room temperature) Everyone loves this recipe and looks forward to a plate.</td><td>amish friendship bread and starter</td><td>153</td><td>70</td><td>1540</td><td>1999-09-06</td><td>['time-to-make', 'course', 'cuisine', 'preparation', 'north-american', 'breads', 'american', 'oven', 'easy', 'dietary', 'amish-mennonite', 'northeastern-united-states', 'quick-breads', 'equipment', 'number-of-servings', '4-hours-or-less']</td><td>[615.9, 32.0, 260.0, 15.0, 16.0, 19.0, 33.0]</td><td>19</td><td>['place one cup each sugar , milk , and flour in large glass or plastic bowl', 'cover lightly with plastic wrap and set on your counter at room temperature', 'stir with a wooden spoon everyday for 17 days', 'on day 18 do nothing', 'on days 19 , 20 , and 21 , stir', 'on day 22 , add 1 cup sugar , 1 cup milk , and 1 cup flour , and stir again', 'on days 23 , 24 , 25 , and 26 stir', 'on day 27 , add 1 cup milk , 1 cup flour , and 1 cup sugar and stir', \"it's now ready to use to make the bread\", 'give away two cups of the starter to two friends , use one to make the bread , and keep one to keep the starter going', 'when you give away a cup of the starter , give these directions for keeping it going: do not refrigerate', 'do not use metal spoon or metal bowl', 'do not cover tightly , cover loosely with plastic wrap', 'amish friendship bread: mix oil , eggs , and vanilla with the starter mix', 'in a separate bowl , mix flour , sugar , baking powder , cinnamon , salt , baking soda , vanilla pudding mix , and nuts', 'add to liquid mixture and stir thoroughly', 'pour into two large well-greased 9x5 inch loaf pans , or one bundt pan , that have been sprinkled with a mixture of cinnamon , sugar , and flour', 'sprinkle more cinnamon and sugar on the tops of the unbaked loaves', 'bake at 325f for one hour or until done']</td><td>many recipes have been posted for the amish bread, but none have included the starter, so i thought i'd send this along.  happy baking!  amish friendship bread and starter</td><td>['sugar', 'milk', 'flour', 'oil', 'eggs', 'vanilla extract', 'baking powder', 'cinnamon', 'salt', 'baking soda', 'instant vanilla pudding', 'nuts']</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>434572</td><td>153</td><td>2007-02-18</td><td>5</td><td>I have eaten many muffins made from this recipe which my sister in-law is sooo good at making.

I got a bit confused with the double cocoa and double sugar quantities listed in the recipe, so the cake got all of them.  I also used very heaped spoons of cocoa as someone else had mentioned it could be a bit more chocolatey.  Will definitely make again.

The changes I made were to use 1.5 tbsp of chili paste (I like spice but would reduce further if not used to it), 2 eggs and 3 tbsp of cornstarch, no pork, no straw mushrooms and substituted dried porcini mushrooms for the dried black fungus. Next time I'd try to find the dried black fungus and cut the water chestnuts into smaller pieces.

This was wonderful, flavorful and very authentic-tasting.

It is my go to recipe, period. \nWe like it hot so I used 3 tablespoons of the garlic/chili sauce. I omitted the carrots and used 2 beaten eggs instead of the more healthy egg substitute.

So I went ahead and put half into a bowl with the egg yolks stirred well return egg mixture to pan, still stirring continuously it was starting to smooth out but then before it could reach boiling point, it started thickening up so much it was pulling away from the pan again and cramping my hand.

I did change the recipe a little, though, to make it a bit easier. 1) To shorten the amount of cooking time, I pricked each potato a few times with a fork, and then microwaved them between two moist paper towels for about 6-8 minutes, or until starting to get soft.  I cut them into chunks (using a pot holder, of course).  I always leave the skin on as it doesn't take away from the taste and does add a little nutrition.  2) I didn't clean the pan between cooking the potatoes and onions and cooking it with the eggs and I had no problem.  I did add about 2 Tbsp. of oil first, though.  3) I added about 1 1/2 - 2 tsp. of salt.  4) I added some sliced scallions/green onions for color.  5) I cooked the omelet on high and waited a few minutes so that I only had to cook each side once.    </td><td>spanish potato omelet  tortilla a la espanola</td><td>280</td><td>40</td><td>1589</td><td>1999-08-18</td><td>['60-minutes-or-less', 'time-to-make', 'course', 'main-ingredient', 'cuisine', 'preparation', 'occasion', 'low-protein', '5-ingredients-or-less', 'appetizers', 'breakfast', 'lunch', 'eggs-dairy', 'potatoes', 'vegetables', 'spanish', 'easy', 'european', 'eggs', 'dietary', 'low-sodium', 'gluten-free', 'free-of-something', 'low-in-something']</td><td>[848.0, 90.0, 18.0, 3.0, 28.0, 45.0, 22.0]</td><td>14</td><td>['heat the oil in a 8-9 inch skillet', 'add the slices of potato one at a time to avoid sticking together', 'alternate layers of potatoes with layers of onions', 'cook slowly over medium heat , turning the potatoes until tender , not brown', 'drain potatoes in a colander , save oil', 'make sure skillet is very clean for later use', 'in a bowl , beat eggs with a fork until slightly foamy', 'salt to taste', 'add the potatoes , press down to cover potatoes completely with egg', 'return to skillet , heat 2 tablespoons of saved oil until smoking point', 'add the mixture , spread it out', 'rapidly , lower the temperature to medium-high', 'shake the pan often to avoid sticking', 'when the bottom is brown , cover the skillet with a plate , turn skillet up-side down , remove tortilla , slide off plate with uncooked side down into skillet and cook the other side , turn several times until cooked']</td><td>null</td><td>['olive oil', 'potatoes', 'onion', 'coarse salt', 'eggs']</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>299531</td><td>280</td><td>2007-02-13</td><td>5</td><td>this is exactly the way that my spanish friends taught me to make this. great recipe. make sure people realize that the high fat count is a bit lower because you drain off most of the oil after the potatoes are cooked.</td><td>spanish potato omelet  tortilla a la espanola</td><td>280</td><td>40</td><td>1589</td><td>1999-08-18</td><td>['60-minutes-or-less', 'time-to-make', 'course', 'main-ingredient', 'cuisine', 'preparation', 'occasion', 'low-protein', '5-ingredients-or-less', 'appetizers', 'breakfast', 'lunch', 'eggs-dairy', 'potatoes', 'vegetables', 'spanish', 'easy', 'european', 'eggs', 'dietary', 'low-sodium', 'gluten-free', 'free-of-something', 'low-in-something']</td><td>[848.0, 90.0, 18.0, 3.0, 28.0, 45.0, 22.0]</td><td>14</td><td>['heat the oil in a 8-9 inch skillet', 'add the slices of potato one at a time to avoid sticking together', 'alternate layers of potatoes with layers of onions', 'cook slowly over medium heat , turning the potatoes until tender , not brown', 'drain potatoes in a colander , save oil', 'make sure skillet is very clean for later use', 'in a bowl , beat eggs with a fork until slightly foamy', 'salt to taste', 'add the potatoes , press down to cover potatoes completely with egg', 'return to skillet , heat 2 tablespoons of saved oil until smoking point', 'add the mixture , spread it out', 'rapidly , lower the temperature to medium-high', 'shake the pan often to avoid sticking', 'when the bottom is brown , cover the skillet with a plate , turn skillet up-side down , remove tortilla , slide off plate with uncooked side down into skillet and cook the other side , turn several times until cooked']</td><td>null</td><td>['olive oil', 'potatoes', 'onion', 'coarse salt', 'eggs']</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>485728</td><td>280</td><td>2007-04-20</td><td>4</td><td>This is exactly like the dish I was served all across Spain.

Tips:  First, just use ordinary olive oil, not an extra virgin, as if won't be able to take the heat.  To avoid crispy potatoes, be sure the oil is at the right temperature (potatoes should cook slowly when dropped in, and shouldn't sound like french fries in a deep frier) and that potatoes are sliced equally thin (my students do this with a mandoline).  My recipe also includes some garlic, which we crush and sautee with the onions in a separate pan just to make things easier (and to give another student a job to do).  The potatoes should NOT be stireed, as they tend to break up and release more starch this way.  One at a time (employ the assistance of another pair of hands to speed this up if you're not cooking alone) is the best way to go.  Keep in mind, you want evenly tender, cooked potatoes.  No browning.  These aren't french fries!  I'm not sure 1 cup of oil is enough.  We don't usually measure, just fill a skillet almost 1/2 full with olive oil, heat, and then put in potatoes as long as they are all covered , so you don't have to stir.  One reviewer mentioned needing a lot of salt.  I had this problem the first time I made it in class as well.  I had skipped a step in my recipe, which recommends salting the potatoes before cooking, along with seasoning the egg with a little salt and pepper.  This really helps a lot, as salting afterwards just doesn't seem to do it.  The salt doesn't penetrate, and you end up with a really salty outside & lack of flavor inside.  If done correctly, the tortilla should only be flipped once.  High heat when you first drop the egg mixture into the pan is important, as in the original recipe.  This helps to avoid sticking.  However, I don't know that I'd go all the way to the smoking point.  Do reduce the heat and allow to cook slowly right after putting the eggs and potatoes into the pan.  Frequent shaking really isn't necessary.  Just run a rubber scraper around the edge and give it a good shake to loosen before you do the famous \"\"flip.\"\"  When the outside edges start to look dry and only the middle looks slightly runny</td><td>spanish potato omelet  tortilla a la espanola</td><td>280</td><td>40</td><td>1589</td><td>1999-08-18</td><td>['60-minutes-or-less', 'time-to-make', 'course', 'main-ingredient', 'cuisine', 'preparation', 'occasion', 'low-protein', '5-ingredients-or-less', 'appetizers', 'breakfast', 'lunch', 'eggs-dairy', 'potatoes', 'vegetables', 'spanish', 'easy', 'european', 'eggs', 'dietary', 'low-sodium', 'gluten-free', 'free-of-something', 'low-in-something']</td><td>[848.0, 90.0, 18.0, 3.0, 28.0, 45.0, 22.0]</td><td>14</td><td>['heat the oil in a 8-9 inch skillet', 'add the slices of potato one at a time to avoid sticking together', 'alternate layers of potatoes with layers of onions', 'cook slowly over medium heat , turning the potatoes until tender , not brown', 'drain potatoes in a colander , save oil', 'make sure skillet is very clean for later use', 'in a bowl , beat eggs with a fork until slightly foamy', 'salt to taste', 'add the potatoes , press down to cover potatoes completely with egg', 'return to skillet , heat 2 tablespoons of saved oil until smoking point', 'add the mixture , spread it out', 'rapidly , lower the temperature to medium-high', 'shake the pan often to avoid sticking', 'when the bottom is brown , cover the skillet with a plate , turn skillet up-side down , remove tortilla , slide off plate with uncooked side down into skillet and cook the other side , turn several times until cooked']</td><td>null</td><td>['olive oil', 'potatoes', 'onion', 'coarse salt', 'eggs']</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>529022</td><td>280</td><td>2008-08-14</td><td>5</td><td>I made this tortilla today for the lab I work for and everybody liked it.

Kenk's is a very traditional recipe and not unlike mine.  However, I do a few things differently.  I have found that coarsely grating my potatoes helps make the tortillas more stable during and after cooking.  I start my onions cooking while I'm grating the potatoes and I cook them in about 3T of olive oil.  I use almost as much onion as potato but I don't add garlic because it damages the delicate flavor of the tortilla and isn't as good cold.  The egg to potato ratio is very important.  Basically the egg mixture should easily cover the potatoes when you mix them together.  After you stir the potatoes into the eggs be sure to let them sit for 5 minutes before you pour them into the hot pan to form tortillas.  I use an 8\"\" omlet pan and usually cook two tortillas.  This pan makes the sliding / flipping process much easier and lets you peek under the edge for doneness.  I actually don't flip my tortillas.  I kept trying but had some incredibly horrible failures.  My method is to slide the tortilla onto a large plate and then invert the pan over it and flip the plate and pan quickly.  During the cooking process (before the slide) I take the pan off the heat and let it rest for a few minutes several time.  This helps the runny center set up.  Just be sure that it is hot and sliding around in the pan before you attempt the slide or flip.  You also want to be careful not to overcook because the finished tortilla is best with a creamy texture.  I frequently stray from the traditional by adding a small amount of grated cheddar to the mix (gives a beautiful golden quality to the crust) and sprinkling some on the finished tortilla.  I used to add red and yellow peppers but it too can overpower the simple but delicious flavor of the tortilla.  My husband cares less about tradition and likes crumbled bacon added to the mix.  I usually give in.  Last thing...practice makes perfect when it comes to tortillas so if your first few tries are less than stellar</td><td>spanish potato omelet  tortilla a la espanola</td><td>280</td><td>40</td><td>1589</td><td>1999-08-18</td><td>['60-minutes-or-less', 'time-to-make', 'course', 'main-ingredient', 'cuisine', 'preparation', 'occasion', 'low-protein', '5-ingredients-or-less', 'appetizers', 'breakfast', 'lunch', 'eggs-dairy', 'potatoes', 'vegetables', 'spanish', 'easy', 'european', 'eggs', 'dietary', 'low-sodium', 'gluten-free', 'free-of-something', 'low-in-something']</td><td>[848.0, 90.0, 18.0, 3.0, 28.0, 45.0, 22.0]</td><td>14</td><td>['heat the oil in a 8-9 inch skillet', 'add the slices of potato one at a time to avoid sticking together', 'alternate layers of potatoes with layers of onions', 'cook slowly over medium heat , turning the potatoes until tender , not brown', 'drain potatoes in a colander , save oil', 'make sure skillet is very clean for later use', 'in a bowl , beat eggs with a fork until slightly foamy', 'salt to taste', 'add the potatoes , press down to cover potatoes completely with egg', 'return to skillet , heat 2 tablespoons of saved oil until smoking point', 'add the mixture , spread it out', 'rapidly , lower the temperature to medium-high', 'shake the pan often to avoid sticking', 'when the bottom is brown , cover the skillet with a plate , turn skillet up-side down , remove tortilla , slide off plate with uncooked side down into skillet and cook the other side , turn several times until cooked']</td><td>null</td><td>['olive oil', 'potatoes', 'onion', 'coarse salt', 'eggs']</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>593927</td><td>280</td><td>2009-08-29</td><td>5</td><td>Delicious for DH, DD (toddler) & I as per my slight modifications. I used two medium small potatoes and 6 eggs but next time would use only 5. I cooked the potatoes in 1/2 inch of extra virgin olive oil (I do suggest regular olive oil like another reviewer because mine smoked too much). I did not let the potatoes brown much at all. I then added the onion in a lesser amount. I covered the pan to slightly steam the potatoes and onions in order not to brown them and to cook them faster. When they were just about cooked I added sea salt (which was not coarse) to them which I think is very important or the dish will come out to bland.

You just use water. In the old days Spaetzles dough was made thinner and put on a cuttingboard then scraped into boiling water. It only takes a couple of minutes..less then 5, for Spaetzle to be done. I actually have a spaetzlesmachine where you fill in the dough and it comes out looking like spagetti, but you stir them up and they break a little, cookingtime is 2 minutes...once they boil take them out. Spaetzlesmachine is much like a potatoricer, there are places on the web where you can buy those. Thats authentic Spaetzle.

It gives me ideas for something else to do with a garden full of rhubarb.</td><td>remarkable rhubarb bites</td><td>445</td><td>75</td><td>1533</td><td>1999-09-10</td><td>['weeknight', 'time-to-make', 'course', 'main-ingredient', 'cuisine', 'preparation', 'occasion', 'north-american', 'for-large-groups', 'desserts', 'lunch', 'fruit', 'american', 'oven', 'easy', 'finger-food', 'picnic', 'summer', 'vegetarian', 'cookies-and-brownies', 'bar-cookies', 'dietary', 'seasonal', 'to-go', 'equipment', 'number-of-servings', 'presentation', '4-hours-or-less']</td><td>[148.4, 7.0, 69.0, 3.0, 2.0, 5.0, 8.0]</td><td>9</td><td>['preheat oven to 350f', 'mix together rhubarb and 1 / 2 cup sugar', 'set aside', 'cream shortening , remaining 1 / 2 cup sugar and brown sugar', 'add egg and then stir in baking soda , salt , cinnamon and flour', 'stir in vanilla , then rhubarb mixture', 'place batter in a greased and floured 13x9\" baking pan and bake for 40-45 minutes', 'let cool , sprinkle with confectioners\\' sugar and cut into 2\" squares', 'nancy {:-)']</td><td>null</td><td>['rhubarb', 'sugar', 'shortening', 'brown sugar', 'egg', 'baking soda', 'salt', 'cinnamon', 'flour', 'vanilla', \"confectioners' sugar\"]</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>242007</td><td>445</td><td>2008-05-20</td><td>5</td><td>Delicious and super easy to make!

Good proportion of coffee to milk and certainly very easy!  I did find it a smidge sweet for my taste.  Next time I would reduce the honey, but I do typically take my coffee with just milk or cream.

I thought the flavors were marvelous, and would easily award 4 stars.  The blend of tarragon, thyme and rosemary in the breading is sublime; it's the first time I've ever liked anything with tarragon, possibly because we used fresh not dried.  We substituted about half the oil in the vinaigrette with white wine instead, and I thought it tasted a bit like commercial salad dressing; no idea if that's due to the substitution.  I thought it might have been brighter if it used fresh-squeezed lemon juice instead of rice wine vinegar.  The horseradish in the breading practically disappears, but that's a hazard of cooking horseradish; it's always strongest uncooked.  Our big change was that we left our 1.3 lb salmon fillet whole w/ skin on the back, seared both sides, but only breaded the skinless side.  We baked 20 min, and it was still cold raw in the middle.  So then we cut into smaller fillets and broiled about 7 minutes and it was finally done just right.  My SO didn't like the breading... there was a lot of it, and we caked it on heavy since it was only on one side.  She said she might prefer a lighter breading, something Japanese-style, or only use 1c. bread crumbs.  She'd only give this 2 or grudgingly 3 stars.

meat, short ribs are best when braised. a long and gentle simmer breaks down the abundant fat and connective tissue, rendering the ribs tender and velvety in texture. veal stock adds its own inherent silky richness. ask the butcher to cut the ribs across the rack, as opposed to along the bone, so there are 3 short bones in every

came out well done; next time we will cut the meat in bigger chunks as we prefer it medium rare.  note that a vitamix can puree the sauce while it is still hot. garlic and ginger paste is available in

anything goes curry</td><td>i believe the word balti actually means \"bucket\"....this famous style of curry is cooked in a balti pan, much like a wok.  i think the reference to bucket means more that you can throw anything in!  i fell in love with balti curries years ago living in birmingham uk - a few blocks from balti central.  what sushi bars are to vancouver, balti houses are to birmingham.  i know this is a very anglo version of balti sauce, a very mild one at that, but it is quite healthy and light....and not lacking any flavour.  it's also fairly quick to prepare compared to some recipes i've tried.  you can boost up the heat factor as you wish.  i included mainly ready ground spices, but of course you could use whole.  if you use whole cardamom seeds or whole coriander i would
